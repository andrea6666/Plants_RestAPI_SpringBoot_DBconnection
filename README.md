## Plants_SpringBootRestApi

### This Spring Boot application provides a RESTful API for managing plant-related information. The main functionalities include creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting plant records. The application is built using Spring Boot, and it utilizes a JPA repository for data persistence. The PlantController class defines RESTful endpoints for handling various operations on plant entities, such as retrieving all plants, getting a plant by its ID or name, searching for plants based on content, creating new plants, updating existing plants, and deleting plants by ID or all plants in the database. The Plant entity represents the data model, and the application ensures proper handling of HTTP requests and responses, making it a straightforward and efficient plant management system.
